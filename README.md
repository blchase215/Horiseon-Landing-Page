# Horiseon Landing Page

## Description

This project was a refactoring of Horiseon's website to improve accessibility.  HTML5 provides us with great semantic tools that affords developers exceptional control, and great legibility.  It  makes it even easier to incorporate accessibility features to make the web available to **_everyone_**!  Now Horiseon will be able to reach even more prospective clients.

## Installation
