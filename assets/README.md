# Horiseon Landing Page

## Description

This project was a refactoring of Horiseon's web site to improve accessibility.  HTML5 provides us with new semantic tools that afford us, as developers, both exceptional control, and great legiibility.  It also makes it even easier to incorporate accessibility features to make the web available to **_everyone_**!
